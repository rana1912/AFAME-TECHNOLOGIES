DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP - : IRIS Flower Classification

# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project aims to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The Iris Flower Classification Project utilizes the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in the field of machine learning, to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The model is trained on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, and then used to predict the species of iris flowers.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Run the `iris_classification.py` file using Python:
python iris_classification.py
4. Follow the instructions provided in the command prompt.

## Files and Folders

- `iris_classification.py`: Python script containing the main code for the Iris Flower Classification project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview, installation instructions, and usage guide.
- `data/`: Optional folder containing the Iris dataset file (`iris.data`).

## Dataset

The Iris dataset (`iris.data`) contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and their corresponding species.
